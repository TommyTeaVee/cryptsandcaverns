# Staking Crypts and Caverns

To earn rewards, players must stake their Crypts and Caverns on Eth Mainnet. Players can stake one or many Dungeons.

Once staked, the staking contract starts accruing rewards earned from any project that we've integrated with. Some projects might require users to take an action (e.g. Realms might say 'venture into your dungeon to earn Divine Cloth') and other projects might just generate passive yield (e.g. a Dungeon Crawler might share 0.1% of gold lost when a player dies in the dungeon).

Yield can be claimed at any time via the contract.

When a player ends a stake, the rewards for that dungeon are auto-claimed and transferred to their account.

*Question: Should we do this? Will it make unstaking cost a ton of gas?*

A dungeon must be re-staked to begin earning rewards again.

Staking can take place on the Crypts and Caverns website or via contract. One or many maps can be staked or unstaked.

# How does this work for L2's?

Games on L2's will have access to mainnet Crypts and Caverns. They will be aware of staking/unstaking and be able to distribute rewards (likely on the L2, not bridged to mainnet).

*Note: TBD on which method we will use to sync L1 ownership/staking data to L2's.*
